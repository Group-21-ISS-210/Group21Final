                <div class="container"><p>It was the start of the semester, and like every other college student, I was full of anticipation and excitement of pursuing the college experience. I had chosen a college that was out of my budget and had taken out student loans to cover my tuition. The problem was how much I had borrowed, and even how I was going to repay it. For the first few weeks of school, I was able to ignore my debt and just focus on my studies. But soon the reality of my situation started to sink in. I was overwhelmed with the amount of money I had borrowed and the realization that I would be paying it back for years to come. The thought of having to repay my debt was always on my mind, and it made it hard to concentrate on my studies. I was constantly worried about how I was going to come up with the money to pay it back, and it was affecting my performance in the classroom.
Student debt is one of the biggest challenges college students have to face. It can have a serious impact on their lives, both present and future. The most obvious impact is financial, as student debt can be a huge burden to manage. It can also make it difficult to pursue further education or take career risks. As such, student debt can have a long-term negative impact on a student's life.</p>

Student debt has a major factor in drop out rates. Too many students begin their post-graduation careers riddled with college debt, more specifically due to the use of student credit cards. Credit cards are convenient and easy for students, but not enough are well-informed on the consequences of credit card misuse, and cannot make educational decisions. Sometimes it is hard for students to upkeep their credit cards because the interest rates keep increasing each year including annual fees. Because most college students don't work or have consistent jobs they can only make the minimum payment. Which means they carry over balances month after month. Eventually affecting their debt to income ratio. As students move through college, they gain more and more credit cards as well as credit card debt without considering the consequences. College students sometimes tend to use their credit cards as everyday purchases while they should be using it for emergencies. When you max out your card they don't only charge interest fees, and annual fees they also charge you an over limit fee. If you don’t make your payment the bank will then add an over limit fee. Many of these fees, and factors could cause not only student debt but credit card debt eventually messing up your credit score as the years pass.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Student debt has dramatically increased as the value or viewpoint of receiving a higher education has increased. This increase in price for higher education can lead to multiple problems that students have to face after loans are taken out. Taking out loans has led to the next generation missing or delaying important milestones, and also developing mental illness. It has been observed that students are waiting to settle into a house, and have children until they are more out of debt, but this can severely alter one's life as they are choosing not to have kids or settle down because higher education is too expensive. Due to the stress of student loans and the pressure to have higher education in order to advance your career, large amounts of student debt can lead to depression and anxiety. Mental health is important to career and academic success, but one’s goals may be hindered because they feel that their goals do not measure up to the importance of paying back student loans. Students will put high levels of pressure on them because they want to ensure that the money being put towards a university education will be worth it. So they will overwork themselves and prioritize school work over mental health. There is also the dispute of student loans from a state funded university and private funded universities. Private universities are inherently more expensive than public universities, but the increase in tuition has made this gap smaller. While private universities are willing to give more aid, if one does not fall into this category they will be in almost double the amount of debt than students who attend public universities. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Students feel chained down by student debts because of the many mental and physical problems that it can cause. Student debt can cause physiological factors such as in areas of self control, delay of gratification, and an adverse opinion on loans in general. Adding to these issues is the effect that debt has on anxiety. Anxiety has been found to cause a decrease in financial well being and being anxious over money relates negatively to financial well being as well. These problems aren't just psychological either. Students with low level incomes and high financial burdens may partake in money saving measures which include not getting medical examinations and not eating meals which can cause long term damage to their health as well as their academics. These factors show that there must be a change in how the educational system is funded. All of the negative effects caused from having debt can deter students from pursuing the education they desire. If the educational system is not made more accessible then students will continue to feel chained down by debt as well as feel the adverse effects from it.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">It would make sense that students feel like they are “dead” when they graduate from secondary education because of the cost. Even when factoring in inflation, the average family wages have gone down and the cost of secondary education has increased. This can make many students feel like they are hopeless - how can they be expected to invest in themselves when the investment will set them back in for the next couple of years, if not decades? Student loan debts act as a stressor that generally destabilizes one's mental health. Despite this, the American secondary education system is set up in such a way that loans are almost inevitable for the majority of the population. This leads me to wonder whether the system is genuinely neglectful or contributing purposefully. Regardless of this, the impact that egregious student loans have on the mental health of students cannot be ignored because it has such a widespread impact. With the way the system is set up, it would make sense that students would avoid furthering their education and pursuing their passions一why put themselves in the position to rack up hundreds of thousands worth of debt for a degree in a field that will pay them a fraction of that? Therefore, the American education system needs to become more accessible, if not free with government subsidization and debt forgiveness.</p>
